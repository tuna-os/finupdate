# finupdate Roadmap

**Last updated**: 2026-08-24 | **Maintainer**: tuna-os (hanthor)

## Mission

Give TunaOS/Bluefin users a modern graphical system updater: one-click
`bootc`/`flatpak`/`brew`/`distrobox` updates behind a single pkexec elevation,
with live log streaming, cancel support, and reboot prompt — so keeping an
immutable system current is a first-class, polished desktop action, not a
terminal chore.

---

## Current Status

- **App**: GTK4/libadwaita in Rust (2024 edition), GNOME 47+.
- **Distribution**: shipped — `flatpak install tuna-os org.tunaos.finupdate`
  live on the TunaOS Flatpak remote (indexed in flatpak-index), OCI at
  ghcr.io/tuna-os/finupdate for x86_64 + aarch64.
- **Versioning**: **none** — zero tags, zero GitHub Releases. The publish
  workflow fires on both `main` push and `v*` tags, so builds flow, but the
  OCI index serves unversioned "current builds" with no tag signal.
- **Health**: active (pushed 08-20); 4 open issues: unpinned privileged
  publish action (#64), unmaintained Cargo.lock dep (#63), God-file spread
  (#62).
