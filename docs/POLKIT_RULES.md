# Polkit Authorization Rules for Finupdate

## Overview

Finupdate requires elevated privileges to interact with bootc and system management operations. This document describes the Polkit rules configured to allow these operations without interactive password prompts during testing and routine use.

## Rule: `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/49-finupdate.rules`

### Purpose
Allows the local user and members of the `wheel` group to execute bootc commands (status, upgrade, etc.) and system reboot operations without password prompts. Designed for:
- Automated testing in CI/CD environments
- Development/debug mode operations
- Non-destructive command verification (bootc status, upgrade checks)

### Configuration
```javascript
// The exec allowlist matches the FULL program path, exactly.
var FINUPDATE_ALLOWED_PROGRAMS = [
    "/usr/bin/bootc",
    "/usr/sbin/bootc",
    "/usr/bin/finupdate-runner",
    "/usr/libexec/finupdate-runner"
];

polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if (subject.isInGroup("wheel")) {
        if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.policykit.exec") {
            var program = action.lookup("program");
            if (program && FINUPDATE_ALLOWED_PROGRAMS.indexOf(program) >= 0) {
                return polkit.Result.YES;
            }
        }
        // Allow systemctl reboot for integration testing
        if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.login1.reboot") {
            return polkit.Result.YES;
        }
    }
});
```

The full shipped rule is `build-aux/49-finupdate.polkit.rules`; keep the two
in step.

**Match the whole path, never a substring.** `program.indexOf("bootc") >= 0`
authorizes every executable whose path merely *contains* that text, so any
unprivileged process can drop a script at `/home/u/bootc/x.sh` or
`/tmp/finupdate-runner-1234.sh` and get it run as root with no password. A
path belongs on the allowlist only if root owns it and no unprivileged user
can write to it or to any directory leading to it.

### Operations Authorized

#### bootc commands (all variants)
- `bootc status --json` — Query current OS image metadata
- `bootc status` — Human-readable status output
- `bootc upgrade` — Stage image upgrades
- `bootc upgrade --check` — Check for available upgrades

Executed via:
- Direct: `pkexec bootc <command>`
- From Flatpak: `flatpak-spawn --host pkexec bootc <command>`

#### System reboot
- `systemctl reboot` — Initiate system restart
- Polkit action: `org.freedesktop.login1.reboot`

### Security Notes

**Scope**: Limited to members of `wheel`, and — for `pkexec` — to the exact
program paths on the allowlist. It does not authorize arbitrary root command
execution *provided* the allowlist stays exact-match and every entry is
root-owned. A substring match, or an entry under a user-writable directory,
removes that guarantee entirely.

**Assumptions**: This configuration assumes members of `wheel` are trusted
with system administration. Note what it still changes even so: `sudo`
normally re-authenticates, and this rule does not. On a machine where the
administrator's `sudo` requires a password, installing this rule means code
running in that user's session — a compromised app, not a person — reaches
the allowlisted programs as root with no prompt at all.

**Non-destructive intent**: The rule authorizes operations that are necessary for update checking and management, not arbitrary system modification. The finupdate application enforces additional safeguards:
- Dev mode prevents actual reboots
- Simulation scenarios allow safe testing without touching the real system

### Installation

The rule is deployed during system setup or when finupdate is initialized:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 build-aux/49-finupdate.polkit.rules \
    /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/49-finupdate.rules
```

Installing the file from the repository rather than pasting a second copy of
the rule keeps one reviewed version of the allowlist.

### Verification

Test that rules are in effect:

```bash
# Should complete without password prompt
flatpak-spawn --host pkexec bootc status --json

# Should show current deployment info
pkexec bootc status
```

### Upstream Proposal

This rule is intended as a model for upstreaming into the Dakota OS layer or a finupdate system package. The specific actions (bootc status, reboot) are legitimate for any system update tool and could be generalized for broader use.
